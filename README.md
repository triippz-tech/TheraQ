# TheraQ

## IN DEVELOPMENT
--
Please note, this is in development, and migrations may be add/removed until the
first MVP is ready to go.

## About
TheraQ is a social-based application where professionals in the healthcare field, specifically of
the Therapy speciality (OT, PT, etc.), can discuss and seek answers to potential treatments and other information.

- PostgreSQL, for DB
- Redis, for Celery
- Sendgrid, for e-mail sending
- Papertrail, for logs and platform errors alerts (must set them manually)


## Running
### Setup
- Inside the `backend` folder, do the following:
- Create a copy of ``theraq/settings/local.py.example``:  
 Â `cp theraq/settings/local.py.example theraq/settings/local.py`
- Create a copy of ``.env.example``:
  `cp .env.example .env`

#### If you are using plain python:
- Create the migrations for `users` app: 
  `python manage.py makemigrations`
- Run the migrations:
  `python manage.py migrate`

#### If you are using Docker:
- Create the migrations for `users` app:  
  `docker-compose run --rm backend python manage.py makemigrations`
- Run the migrations:
  `docker-compose run --rm backend python manage.py migrate`

### Tools
- Setup [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/), [prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) and [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) in the text editor you will use to develop.

### Running the project (without docker)
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
- Open another command line window.
- `workon theprojectname` or `source theprojectname/bin/activate` depending on if you are using virtualenvwrapper or just virtualenv.
- Go to the `backend` directory.
- `python manage.py runserver`


### Running the project (with docker)
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory.
- `docker-compose up -d `
To access the logs for each service run `docker-compose logs -f service_name` (either backend, frontend, etc)

#### Celery
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory
- `workon theprojectname` or `source theprojectname/bin/activate` depending on if you are using virtualenvwrapper or just virtualenv.
- `python manage.py celery`

### Testing
`make test`

Will run django tests using `--keepdb` and `--parallel`. You may pass a path to the desired test module in the make command. E.g.:

`make test someapp.tests.test_views`

### Adding new pypi libs
Add the libname to either requirements.in or dev-requirents.in, then either upgrade the libs with `make upgrade` or manually compile it and then,  install.
`pip-compile requirements.in > requirements.txt` or `make upgrade`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Deployment 
### Setup
This project comes with an `app.json` file, which can be used to create an app on Heroku from a GitHub repository.

After setting up the project, you can init a repository and push it on GitHub. If your repository is public, you can use the following button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/triippz-tech/TheraQ) 

If you are in a private repository, access the following link replacing `$YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK$` with your repository link.

- `https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/triippz-tech/TheraQ`

Remember to fill the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with the URL of your app, the default on heroku is `appname.herokuapp.com`. Replace `appname` with your heroku app name.

### Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is already set up on the project. For production, add `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on Heroku, with your Sentry DSN as the value.

You can test your Sentry configuration by deploying the boilerplate with the sample page and clicking on the corresponding button.

### Sentry source maps for JS files

The `bin/post_compile` script has a step to push Javascript source maps to Sentry, however some environment variables need to be set on Heroku.

You need to enable Heroku dyno metadata on your Heroku App. Use the following command on Heroku CLI:

- `heroku labs:enable runtime-dyno-metadata -a <app name>`

The environment variables that need to be set are:

- `SENTRY_ORG` - Name of the Sentry Organization that owns your Sentry Project.
- `SENTRY_PROJECT_NAME` - Name of the Sentry Project.
- `SENTRY_API_KEY` - Sentry API key that needs to be generated on Sentry. [You can find or create authentication tokens within Sentry](https://sentry.io/api/).

After enabling dyno metadata and setting the environment variables, your next Heroku Deploys will create a release on Sentry where the release name is the commit SHA, and it will push the source maps to it.

## Linting
- Manually with `prospector` and `npm run lint` on project root.
- During development with an editor compatible with prospector and ESLint.

## Pre-commit hooks
- Run `pre-commit install` to enable the hook into your git repo. The hook will run automatically for each commit.
- Run `git commit -m "Your message" -n` to skip the hook if you need.


### `CELERY_ACKS_LATE = True`
We believe Celery tasks should be idempotent. So for us it's safe to set `CELERY_ACKS_LATE = True` to ensure tasks will be re-queued after a worker failure. Check Celery docs on ["Should I use retry or acks_late?"](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/faq.html#should-i-use-retry-or-acks-late) for more info.
